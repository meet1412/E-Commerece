Technologies Used

Operating System:

The ecommerce website is designed to be compatible with three major operating systems: Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu. This ensures that users can access the website seamlessly regardless of the operating system they are using.

Coding Language:

The primary coding languages used in the development of the ecommerce website are Python and JavaScript. Python is a powerful and versatile language known for its simplicity and readability, making it ideal for backend development tasks. JavaScript is a widely used programming language for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

Frameworks:

The ecommerce website utilizes two popular frameworks: React.js and Django. React.js is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of interactive and responsive UI components, making the website more engaging and user-friendly. Django, on the other hand, is a high-level Python web framework that provides a robust foundation for developing scalable and secure web applications. It simplifies the development process by offering various tools and features for handling common web development tasks.

Additional framework:

Node.js is also employed in the ecommerce website. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows server-side execution of JavaScript, making it suitable for building scalable and efficient web applications. Node.js enables developers to create real-time applications and handle a large number of concurrent connections.

Database:

The ecommerce website uses MongoDB as the database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides flexibility and scalability for handling large volumes of data. It stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON, allowing for easy integration with the Python and JavaScript languages used in the website's development. MongoDB document-oriented architecture enables efficient retrieval and storage of data related to products, orders, customer profiles, and more.

Cloud Platform:

The ecommerce website is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is a widely used cloud computing platform that offers a range of services and tools for building, deploying, and managing web applications. It provides scalable and reliable infrastructure, ensuring the website's availability and performance. AWS services such as EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), S3 (Simple Storage Service), and RDS (Relational Database Service) are utilized for hosting the website, storing static assets, and managing the database, respectively.
In conclusion, the ecommerce website is developed using a combination of Python and JavaScript, with React.js, Django, and Node.js as the frameworks. The website is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu operating systems. MongoDB is used as the database for efficient data storage, and AWS is employed as the cloud platform for hosting and managing the website.
The hardware specifications of the server hosting the website play a crucial role in its performance and stability. Here is a detailed explanation of an ecommerce website along with specific hardware specifications:
