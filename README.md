These reviews will make them positive against the product. Furthermore, because of searches what individuals will make, the recommendation engine suggests other product in which they may take interest.
If we are talking about the payment, all the information secures in the database which is related to peopleâ€™s credits and debits. At last, people can place order, track, check the delivery status and receives it.
The Cloud platform that we are using is AWS platform.
The language that are using is Python.

Technologies Used
Operating System:
The ecommerce website is designed to be compatible with three major operating systems: Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu. This ensures that users can access the website seamlessly regardless of the operating system they are using.
Coding Language:
The primary coding languages used in the development of the ecommerce website are Python and JavaScript. Python is a powerful and versatile language known for its simplicity and readability, making it ideal for backend development tasks. JavaScript is a widely used programming language for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Frameworks:
The ecommerce website utilizes two popular frameworks: React.js and Django. React.js is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of interactive and responsive UI components, making the website more engaging and user-friendly. Django, on the other hand, is a high-level Python web framework that provides a robust foundation for developing scalable and secure web applications. It simplifies the development process by offering various tools and features for handling common web development tasks.
Additional framework:
Node.js is also employed in the ecommerce website. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows server-side execution of JavaScript, making it suitable for building scalable and efficient web applications. Node.js enables developers to create real-time applications and handle a large number of concurrent connections.
Database:
The ecommerce website uses MongoDB as the database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides flexibility and scalability for handling large volumes of data. It stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON, allowing for easy integration with the Python and JavaScript languages used in the website's development. MongoDB document-oriented architecture enables efficient retrieval and storage of data related to products, orders, customer profiles, and more.
Cloud Platform:
The ecommerce website is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is a widely used cloud computing platform that offers a range of services and tools for building, deploying, and managing web applications. It provides scalable and reliable infrastructure, ensuring the website's availability and performance. AWS services such as EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), S3 (Simple Storage Service), and RDS (Relational Database Service) are utilized for hosting the website, storing static assets, and managing the database, respectively.
In conclusion, the ecommerce website is developed using a combination of Python and JavaScript, with React.js, Django, and Node.js as the frameworks. The website is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu operating systems. MongoDB is used as the database for efficient data storage, and AWS is employed as the cloud platform for hosting and managing the website.
The hardware specifications of the server hosting the website play a crucial role in its performance and stability. Here is a detailed explanation of an ecommerce website along with specific hardware specifications:
System:
The ecommerce website runs on a system equipped with an Intel Core i3 processor. The Intel Core i3 processor is a mid-range CPU known for its efficient performance and affordability. It provides enough processing power to handle the website's operations smoothly.
Hard Disk:
The website requires a minimum of 10GB of hard disk space. This space is used for storing the website's files, including the source code, images, product information, and database. A 10GB hard disk ensures that there is ample storage capacity to accommodate the website's content and future expansion.
Monitor:
For the system running the ecommerce website, a 15-inch VGA color monitor is used. The monitor's size provides sufficient screen real estate to view and manage the website's backend interface comfortably. The VGA color display ensures accurate and vibrant representation of the website's user interface and other visual elements.
Mouse:
The ecommerce website is operated using a Logitech mouse. Logitech is a renowned brand known for manufacturing reliable and ergonomic computer peripherals. The mouse's precise tracking and comfortable design contribute to a smooth navigation experience while managing the website's backend tasks.
RAM:
A minimum of 4GB of RAM is installed in the system running the ecommerce website. RAM (Random Access Memory) is responsible for temporarily storing data and instructions that the system requires to execute tasks efficiently. With 4GB of RAM, the website can handle multiple concurrent requests, database operations, and other computational tasks without significant performance bottlenecks.
These hardware specifications provide a baseline for running an ecommerce website efficiently. However, it's important to note that the actual hardware requirements can vary depending on the website's scale, complexity, and anticipated traffic. As the website grows and attracts more visitors, it may be necessary to upgrade the hardware to ensure optimal performance and user experience.
